# Warbler

Warbler is an open source, decentralized commenting system you can embed in your websites. We're currently under active development and hope to have a release ready for you soon.

[**Demo**](https://warbler.netlify.com/demo/test.html)

Warbler is split into an embeddable frontend, an [open-source backend](https://github.com/warblerorg/warbler-server), and an [API schema](https://github.com/warblerorg/warbler-api) so you can choose to write a custom client or server implementation.

The Warbler frontend is designed to be easily customizable and styleable. With basic CSS, it's easy to customize Warbler however you like. If you're looking for a solution that's ready out of the box, use one of the existing themes.

## Running

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npx http-server | npm run build -- --watch
```
